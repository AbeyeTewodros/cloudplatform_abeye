            <h1>Virtualization Fundamentals</h1>
            <p>Virtualization is a key technology in cloud computing that allows for the creation of virtual versions of computing resources such as servers, storage devices, and networks. By abstracting physical hardware and decoupling it from the underlying software, virtualization enables greater flexibility, scalability, and efficiency in resource utilization.</p>
            <h3>Overview of Virtualization Technology</h3>
            <p>Virtualization technology enables the creation of virtual instances of physical hardware, including servers, storage, and networking components. These virtual instances, known as virtual machines (VMs), operate independently of the underlying physical hardware, allowing multiple VMs to run on a single physical server.</p>
            <h3>Benefits and Use Cases of Virtualization in Cloud Computing</h3>
            <p>Virtualization offers several benefits in cloud computing, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Resource Optimization: Virtualization allows for efficient utilization of hardware resources by consolidating multiple virtual machines on a single physical server.</li>
                <li>Scalability: Virtualization enables rapid provisioning and scaling of virtual machines to meet changing workload demands.</li>
                <li>Cost Savings: By reducing the need for physical hardware and optimizing resource usage, virtualization helps lower infrastructure costs.</li>
                <li>Isolation and Security: Virtualization provides isolation between virtual machines, enhancing security and reducing the risk of resource contention.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Types of Virtualization</h3>
            <p>There are several types of virtualization, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Server Virtualization: In server virtualization, multiple virtual machines run on a single physical server, allowing for efficient resource utilization.</li>
                <li>Storage Virtualization: Storage virtualization abstracts physical storage devices and presents them as a single virtual storage pool, simplifying management and improving scalability.</li>
                <li>Network Virtualization: Network virtualization enables the creation of virtual networks that operate independently of the underlying physical network infrastructure, providing flexibility and agility in network management.</li>
            </ul>
