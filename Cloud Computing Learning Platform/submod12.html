            <h1>Cloud Deployment Models</h1>
            <p>Cloud deployment models define the type and scope of cloud computing environments. They dictate how cloud services are provisioned and shared among users and organizations. The main cloud deployment models include:</p>
            <h3>Public Cloud</h3>
            <p>Public cloud refers to cloud services offered by third-party providers over the public internet. In a public cloud model, computing resources such as virtual machines, storage, and applications are shared among multiple users or tenants. Public cloud services are typically provided on a pay-as-you-go basis, offering scalability and cost-efficiency to users.</p>
            <h3>Private Cloud</h3>
            <p>Private cloud involves the provisioning and management of cloud services within a dedicated infrastructure that is isolated from other users. Private clouds can be hosted on-premises within an organization's data center or provided by a third-party service provider. Private cloud environments offer greater control, security, and customization compared to public cloud deployments.</p>
            <h3>Hybrid Cloud</h3>
            <p>Hybrid cloud combines elements of public and private cloud infrastructure to create a unified computing environment. In a hybrid cloud model, organizations can leverage both public and private cloud services interchangeably based on workload requirements, data sensitivity, and regulatory compliance. Hybrid cloud architecture enables seamless data and application portability between on-premises and cloud environments.</p>
            <h3>Community Cloud</h3>
            <p>Community cloud is a collaborative cloud computing model that serves the needs of a specific community or group of organizations with shared interests, such as industry consortiums, research communities, or government agencies. Community cloud environments are designed to meet the unique requirements and compliance standards of the participating organizations while promoting resource sharing and collaboration.</p>
