            <h1>Cloud Service Models</h1>
            <p>Cloud service models define the types of services offered by cloud providers. The three primary cloud service models are:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):</strong> IaaS provides virtualized computing resources over the internet, including virtual machines, storage, and networking infrastructure. Users can rent these resources on a pay-as-you-go basis, allowing for flexible scaling of IT infrastructure without the need for physical hardware.</li>
                <li><strong>Platform as a Service (PaaS):</strong> PaaS offers a platform for developers to build, deploy, and manage applications without the complexity of infrastructure management. PaaS providers offer development tools, middleware, and runtime environments, enabling developers to focus on application development rather than underlying infrastructure.</li>
                <li><strong>Software as a Service (SaaS):</strong> SaaS delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis, eliminating the need for users to install, maintain, and update software locally. Common examples of SaaS applications include email services, office productivity suites, and customer relationship management (CRM) software.</li>
            </ol>
